    \item Reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off. We have access to a lot more computational power. Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition. We have access to a lot more data.
    \item Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly. Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea. Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).
    \item A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “structured” data by opposition to image, audio or text datasets.
    \item Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? It can be trained as a supervised learning problem. It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
