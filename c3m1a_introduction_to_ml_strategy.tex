\subsection{Orthogonalization}

In orthogonalization, you have some controls, but each control does a specific task and doesn't affect other controls. For a supervised learning system to do well, we want to tune the knobs of our system to improve each of these accuracies one at a time:

\begin{itemize}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
\itemsep0em 
    \item Fit train set well on cost function (near human level performance if possible).
    \item Fit dev set well on cost function.
    \item Fit test set well on cost function.
    \item erforms well in real world. \vspace*{-\baselineskip}
\end{itemize}
