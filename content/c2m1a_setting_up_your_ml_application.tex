\section{Setting Up Your ML Application}

\subsection{Train, Dev, and Test Data Sets}

\begin{itemize}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
\itemsep0em 
    \item Build model using train set then optimize hyperparameters on dev set. Once final model is selected, then evaluate on test set.
    \item For small data (100 to 10,000 examples), split 60-20-20.
    \item For large data (1,000,000+ examples), split 98-1-1.
    \item Make sure the dev and test set are coming from the same distribution, but it's okay if the training set comes from a different distribution. \vspace*{-\baselineskip}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bias and Variance}

We want low bias and low variance. High bias means model is underfit. High variance means model is overfit.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c c}
Train Error & 1\% & 15\% & 15\% & 0.5\% \\ 
Dev Error & 11\% & 16\% & 30\% & 1\% \\  
Bias & Low & High & High & Low \\  
Variance & High & Low & High & Low \vspace{-2.5mm}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For high bias, we can train a larger network or perform an architecture search. For high variance, we can use more data, add regularization, or perform an architecture search.
