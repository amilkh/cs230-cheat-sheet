\section{Learning from Multiple Tasks}

Transfer learning makes sense if:

\begin{itemize}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
\itemsep0em 
    \item Task A and B have the same input x.
    \item You have a lot more data for Task A than Task B.
    \item Low level features from A could be helpful for learning B. \vspace*{-\baselineskip}
\end{itemize}

Hyperparameters for transfer learning are: layers to keep, layers to add, and parameters to freeze or re-tune.
